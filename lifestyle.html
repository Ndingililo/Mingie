          <p class="card_text">-] St Petersburg holds the title of ‘Venice of the North’ for its numerous rivers and canals. The city was first founded on a group of islands, with travel between them intended only by boat. Later in the 18th century, the first bridges were constructed. Now, St Petersburg has 342 bridges around the rivers and canals of the cities, with the most famous ones over the main river – the Neva. The Palace Bridge is drawn every night and has become one of the most recognisable symbols of the city.</p>

As a result of this phenomenon which occurs in many northern cities, St. Petersburg throws the White Nights Festival. Every day throughout the summer you can attend ballets and operas at the Mariinsky Theatre. </p>

Now, the tradition carries on, bringing the highest quality of ballet to audiences from around the world.

          <p class="card_text">Saint Petersburg’s nickname «an open-air architecture museum» says for itself. The city is known for its architectural offerings: Baroque, Classiсism, Constructivism, Northern modern, the list goes on. Nonetheless this mixture of styles doesn’t mean the existence of eclecticism, which is the feature of Moscow, for example. On the contrary the city architecture has its own logic, unity, uniqueness, order and rules.</p>

Climb to the top and forget about things to see in St. Petersburg, because from here you can see it all. Built by French-born architect Auguste Montferrand, St. Isaac’s Cathedral was once the largest in the country. And, while it may now lose out in size to Moscow’s Church of Christ the Saviour, it still boasts the better facade and interio</p>
